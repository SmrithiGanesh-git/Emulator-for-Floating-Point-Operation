Here I am trying to create an emulator to support an underlying processor that does not have the hardware support for floating-point operation. This routine will be called everytime an opcode related to floating point
addition or subtraction is encountered. The routine is written in C++ and here the focus has been to try to manipulate IEEE 754 floating point or single precision (32-bit).

The current design will at least require floating point registers to store the result, this is the minimum hardware requirement.
